Description: Main functions extract a user defined subset of satellite data from nc or hdf5 files which are then available for further analyses and can also be displayed in maps. Currently supported NOAA products includes: Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (from Aqua satellite: MODIS-Aqua) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Also, The functions have been tested with sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and net ocean primary production from Oregon State University.
